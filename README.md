# Assistant Code Evaluator

![ACE Slogan](https://github.com/LESTeamC/assistant-code-evaluator/blob/master/mockups/Assistant%20code%20evaluator%20(2).jpg)

In the context of Software Engineering Laboratory, integrated in Masters Degree in Software Engineering we developed "Assitant Code Evaluator".<br>
The main purpose of this system is to aid professor's task of grading exams on computer science degrees.

The platofrm aims to rescue computer science professors that have the duty to evaluate code samples for lots of students!
Sometimes automated tests just won't do, because there are cases where the student's code doesn't even execute because of compile time and/or runtime errors.

Our platform allows the teacher/system administrator to perform several tasks:
- Create and Edit Exams and Exercises, with different evaluation criteria;
- Create evaluators and assign an account to a teacher;
- Delegate exercises to different teachers, so they can perform evaluation tasks;
- Submit the student's code samples;
- Preview the evaluation process for each exercise and each submission;
- Export the final grades from a given exam;
- Evaluate each submission, analysing the submitted code in a friendly window, according to several criteria.
